epub_css
========

This repository contains my personal epub css files.


Installation
------------

1. Open Calibre
2. Right click the book you want to edit then click ‘Edit book’.
3. On the file browser on the left side, look for `idGeneratedStyles.css` then append the contents
   of `style.css` at the beginning.
4. Save your changes, then re-launch the epub file.
5. If you encounter inconsistencies, like an unchanged `font-family`, remove conflicting
   `font-family` properties.
