epub_css
========

This repository contains my personal epub css files.


Installation
------------

1. Open Calibre
2. Look for the book which matches the ISBN-10 embedded within the filename of the CSS files.
3. Right click the book then click ‘Edit book’.
4. On the file browser on the left side, look for `idGeneratedStyles.css` then replace its contents
   with the contents of the respective CSS file you found in step 1.
5. Save your changes, then re-launch the epub file.
